      "primaryText": "If you've given up on Facebook ads for your fitness business… I get it. You probably blew a few thousand bucks. Got a flood of leads who couldn't afford a $20 Costco membership... let alone your high-ticket program. And you swore ads off forever. I get it… But here's the thing… If you haven't tried ads in the last YEAR... You're basing your opinion on an algorithm that doesn't even exist anymore. Facebook rolled out two MASSIVE updates just a few months ago called Andromeda and Lattice. I'm not gonna bore you with the techy details... But the short version is this: It's never been easier to attract clients who can actually afford to work with you. Not tire-kickers. Not \"let me think about it\" people. But actual real buyers. And that's where my company comes in. Because I've helped over 700 fitness coaches build predictable client acquisition systems using Facebook ads. And the last few months I have just never seen results like this before. We're seeing results that would've been straight-up impossible two years ago. Like Nick... Who tried ads for MONTHS with zero success, but used our system to book 15 calls that turned into $20k in sales. Or Amir... Who burned through $5K in failed ads before working with us, but within 4 days of working with us he made $7k in sales using our updated approach. Or Ryan and Danielle... Who wasted THOUSANDS on agencies that got them nothing but broke leads. But with MY ad system, they only had to spend $300 in ads to generate $7k in sales. Each of these people had FAILED with Facebook ads before. But now? They've got a predictable, reliable lead gen system that actually works. The reason they got results like this is because we built our Instagram Authority Funnel specifically around these new algorithm updates. So here's what I'm offering... Give me just 10 days to install our Instagram Authority Funnel at zero risk to you. Now... let me be clear. This is ONLY for online fitness coaches who: 1. Have great client results AND 2. Have a budget to spend on ads. If that's you... Then do this: Click the link below. Fill out a 60-second application. Book a call with me where I'll demo the Instagram Authority Funnel so you can see how it works from A to Z. And you can decide for yourself if it makes sense. Sound fair? Cool. Talk soon. -Will",
