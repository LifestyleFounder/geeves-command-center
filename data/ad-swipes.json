Dan and Taki break down the philosophy behind building a media infrastructure that you actually own, rather than indefinitely renting attention from the algorithms.\\n\\nWe go deep on the psychology of influence: why \u201cexpertise\u201d can sometimes be a liability, how to design creative workflows that scale beyond the founder, and the specific mental models required to turn a personal brand into a defensive moat for your business.",

They're operating at maybe 5% clarity.\\n\\nThat's why nothing gets done the way you envision it.\\n\\nThe problem isn't that your team can't execute. The problem is you don't know how to communicate as a CEO.\\n\\nMost entrepreneurs can work one-on-one with 2-3 people just fine. But the minute they hit 7, 10, or 20 team members? They're completely lost.\\n\\nThey don't know how to mobilize competing priorities or talk to multiple people without everything falling through the cracks.\\n\\nSo they become the bottleneck. Everything has to go through them because they're the only one who \"really gets it.\"\\n\\nHere's the truth: Communication isn't just saying something. It's message sent, message received, and message acted upon.\\n\\nJust because you said it doesn't mean they heard what you meant. And even if they heard it, that doesn't mean they know how to act on it.\\n\\nIn this video, I break down the exact communication framework that allows you to scale from 3 people to 50+ without losing your mind.\\n\\nThis is the same system that prevents your team from guessing and gets them executing at the level you're thinking.\\n\\nIf you're tired of being the translation department for your own ideas, watch this now.",

Only after 7 days of learning do you need to decide if you want to stick around and continue learning for the normal price of $29/mo.\\n\\nSo if you want to try the exact method that so many of our 200 community members say is the first thing that\u2019s actually made Spanish click for them\u2026\\n\\nClick here to join for free https://www.skool.com/gonespeaking/about/\\n\\nSee you inside,\\nRob",

      "primaryText": "By now, you\u2019re not trying to be convinced.\nYou\u2019re trying to be sure.\n\nYou\u2019ve already done the thinking most people avoid.\n\nYou\u2019ve admitted Instagram brings clients you don\u2019t want.\nYou\u2019ve accepted that more effort isn\u2019t the answer.\nYou\u2019ve recognized that environment shapes buyer quality.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t about whether LinkedIn works.\n\nIt\u2019s about whether this approach fits the kind of business you\u2019re building.\n\nAt this stage, you\u2019re not interested in experiments, trends, or \u201ctry this and see\u201d strategies. You\u2019re interested in leverage.\n\nYou want to know whether this attracts people who decide quickly.\nWhether it reduces emotional labor instead of adding to it.\nWhether it lets you charge more without constantly justifying it.\n\nAnd just as importantly, whether it forces you to become someone you don\u2019t want to be.\n\nThat last part matters more than most people admit.\n\nYou didn\u2019t build your business to become louder.\nYou didn\u2019t build it to perform for attention.\nYou didn\u2019t build it to chase.\n\nYou built it because you\u2019re competent, and competence should compound.\n\nMost marketing systems fall apart at this stage for one reason. They optimize for volume instead of fit.\n\nThey assume everyone wants more leads.\nThey assume more conversations are better.\nThey assume scale means exposure.\n\nYou already know better.\n\nYou don\u2019t want more calls, more DMs, or more explaining.\nYou want cleaner conversations.\n\nConversations that start with:\n\u201cI read what you wrote.\u201d\n\u201cThis made sense to me.\u201d\n\u201cI think we should talk.\u201d\n\nThat only happens when your thinking is visible, your positioning is clear, and your authority is placed intentionally.\n\nThis is where most coaches get tripped up.\n\nThey hear \u201cLinkedIn plus content plus ads\u201d and imagine posting daily, becoming corporate, or running ads that feel salesy.\n\nThat\u2019s not what this is.\n\nThis is about placement, not performance.\n\nIt\u2019s about putting the right ideas in front of the right people consistently so the wrong people never raise their hand in the first place.\n\nThat\u2019s why this only works for a specific kind of coach.\n\nIt works if you already have results.\nIf you already charge premium prices.\nIf you already know who you don\u2019t want to work with.\n\nIt does not work if you\u2019re new, need validation, or want fast dopamine from likes and comments.\n\nLinkedIn doesn\u2019t reward enthusiasm. It rewards judgment. And judgment only lands when it\u2019s grounded in experience.\n\nThis approach assumes you can articulate how high performers think, understand tradeoffs instead of just tactics, and explain fitness as a performance asset rather than a vanity goal.\n\nIf that excites you, this fits.\nIf it intimidates you, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s something else worth saying plainly.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about abandoning Instagram.\nIt\u2019s about no longer depending on it.\n\nInstagram stays where it works best: visibility, social proof, light touchpoints.\nIt just stops being the engine.\n\nLinkedIn becomes where decisions are made, authority is built, and premium demand originates.\n\nThat separation alone changes how your business feels.\n\nYou stop dreading leads.\nYou stop bracing for conversations.\nYou stop negotiating your value.\n\nThe people who reach out already see you as a peer, not a personality.\n\nPrices rise naturally. Not because you forced them, but because the room changed.\n\nThis is the difference between a business that scales with effort and one that scales with positioning.\n\nOne always feels busy.\nThe other feels calm.\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading, you\u2019re past curiosity. You\u2019re evaluating standards.\n\nThis is for online fitness coaches doing $12K to $25K a month who want fewer, better clients, higher prices without resistance, authority that compounds, and a business that doesn\u2019t depend on daily output.\n\nIt\u2019s not for beginners, influencers, or anyone chasing hype, hacks, or shortcuts.\n\nThat\u2019s intentional.\n\nThe goal isn\u2019t to help everyone grow.\nIt\u2019s to help the right people grow without sacrificing their standards.\n\nIf that aligns, you already know what to do.\n\nSee how this works.",

      "primaryText": "Once you realize Instagram isn\u2019t broken, it\u2019s just doing exactly what it was designed to do, a new question takes over.\n\nNot: \u201cHow do I post better?\u201d\nBut: \u201cWhere do the kinds of clients I actually want spend their time?\u201d\n\nThis is the turning point for most online fitness coaches who are doing real money but feel capped. They finally stop trying to force Instagram to behave like something it\u2019s not.\n\nBecause Instagram is a consumer platform. It\u2019s built for browsing, relating, consuming, and delaying. Which means it naturally attracts people who want to feel ready before they decide.\n\nThat\u2019s fine early on.\n\nBut once you want higher prices, fewer clients, faster decisions, and less emotional labor, you start needing a different kind of room. A room where people already make decisions for a living.\n\nThis is where the conversation shifts from content strategy to environment. Because environment shapes behavior. Put the same offer in two different places and you\u2019ll get two completely different types of buyers. Not because the offer changed. Because the context did.\n\nHigh-level clients, business owners, executives, decision-makers, don\u2019t look for solutions the same way consumers do. They don\u2019t scroll hoping to feel inspired. They don\u2019t need motivation. They don\u2019t want entertainment.\n\nThey want clarity.\n\nThey want to read, evaluate, recognize expertise quickly, and move on.\n\nThat\u2019s why they naturally gravitate toward environments built around professional identity. Places where long-form thinking is normal, credentials matter, authority is respected, and decisions are expected.\n\nThis is where LinkedIn quietly outperforms every other platform for high-end clients. Not because it\u2019s trendy or new, but because of why people are there.\n\nPeople don\u2019t open LinkedIn to kill time. They open it to learn, evaluate, decide, and hire. They\u2019re already in a business mindset.\n\nSo when fitness expertise shows up in that context, it lands differently. It\u2019s no longer \u201cHere\u2019s how to get in shape.\u201d It becomes \u201cHere\u2019s how high performers protect energy, longevity, and execution.\u201d\n\nThat subtle shift changes everything. Because decision-makers don\u2019t buy fitness. They buy performance continuity. They buy the ability to show up sharper, think clearer, and lead longer.\n\nWhen your message is placed inside a professional environment, you stop competing with influencers, trends, and noise. You start competing with consultants, advisors, and experts.\n\nThat\u2019s a very different playing field.\n\nThis is also why long-form content matters so much more here. A 1,000-word article that explains how you think will outperform 100 short posts when it comes to client quality. Not in likes or comments, but in the tone of the conversations it creates.\n\nPeople who reach out after reading long-form authority don\u2019t ask \u201cHow much is it?\u201d They ask \u201cWhat does working together look like?\u201d or \u201cAre you taking on clients right now?\u201d Because they\u2019ve already decided you\u2019re competent. They\u2019re just checking for fit.\n\nThis is the moment many online fitness coaches feel something unexpected: relief.\n\nFor the first time, growth doesn\u2019t feel like louder posting, more DMs, or more filtering. It feels like placement. Putting your thinking in front of people who already value thinking.\n\nAnd once you experience even one or two conversations that feel clean, with no convincing, no explaining, and no emotional labor, it\u2019s hard to go back.\n\nYou realize this is what was missing. Not a better script. Not tighter boundaries. A better environment.\n\nInstagram didn\u2019t fail you. It just isn\u2019t where elite clients decide.\n\nLinkedIn isn\u2019t magic. It\u2019s simply where decisions already happen.\n\nAnd when you understand that, marketing stops feeling like something you have to push. It starts feeling like something you place.\n\nThat\u2019s the lever that replaces effort at this stage. Not hacks. Not hustle. Not hype.\n\nAuthority, in the right room.\n\nIf you want to see how this works in practice, tap Learn More.",

      "primaryText": "By this point, something has clicked.\n\nYou\u2019re no longer wondering whether Instagram is sending the wrong clients. You\u2019re no longer questioning whether decision-makers exist outside of it. You know they do.\n\nThe real question now is quieter and more dangerous:\n\nWhat if LinkedIn could work for me, but I mess it up?\n\nBecause LinkedIn has a reputation. Corporate. Cringe. Spammy. Full of people shouting advice they don\u2019t follow. And the last thing you want is to trade Instagram DMs for cold messages that make you feel like a desperate salesperson in a blazer.\n\nSo you hesitate.\n\nNot because you doubt the platform, but because you don\u2019t trust the execution.\n\nThat hesitation is justified.\n\nMost online fitness coaches who try LinkedIn fail for one simple reason. They bring Instagram behavior into a professional environment.\n\nThey post short, vague motivation. They talk about discipline without context. They chase engagement instead of credibility.\n\nWhen it doesn\u2019t work, they conclude: \u201cLinkedIn doesn\u2019t work for fitness.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s like walking into a boardroom and yelling like you\u2019re on a stage. The room isn\u2019t wrong. The behavior is.\n\nLinkedIn doesn\u2019t reward charisma. It rewards clarity. It doesn\u2019t reward frequency. It rewards thoughtfulness. And it absolutely does not reward trying to hack attention.\n\nWhat it rewards is this: can you clearly articulate a problem that high performers already know they have, and explain it in a way that makes them trust your judgment?\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nThe mistake most fitness coaches make is assuming LinkedIn is about being professional. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about being precise.\n\nDecision-makers don\u2019t want inspiration. They want to recognize competence quickly.\n\nThat\u2019s why long-form content works so well here. Not blogs for SEO. Not motivational essays. Clear, grounded explanations that show how you think, how you diagnose problems, and how you make decisions.\n\nWhen a business owner reads something and thinks, \u201cThis person understands pressure, tradeoffs, and execution,\u201d they don\u2019t ask for proof. They assume it.\n\nThis is also why paid ads on LinkedIn work very differently than anywhere else. They\u2019re not meant to convert the way Instagram ads do. They\u2019re meant to place authority at scale. Quietly putting the right thinking in front of the right people, without noise, without chasing, without DM gymnastics.\n\nDone correctly, LinkedIn doesn\u2019t feel like marketing. It feels like being visible in the right rooms, having fewer and better conversations, and letting people self-select before they ever reach out.\n\nThis is the part most coaches miss.\n\nThey think LinkedIn is about posting more, messaging more, hustling harder. In reality, it\u2019s about doing less, but doing it in the right order.\n\nPositioning first. You don\u2019t talk about fitness. You talk about performance, longevity, and decision fatigue.\n\nLong-form authority second. One clear article can outperform months of short posts.\n\nPaid amplification third. Not to sell, but to consistently place your thinking in front of decision-makers.\n\nWhen this is done right, something subtle happens.\n\nThe tone of inbound changes.\n\nPeople don\u2019t say, \u201cHey, how much is it?\u201d\nThey say, \u201cI read your article.\u201d\n\u201cI agree with how you framed that.\u201d\n\u201cI think we should talk.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the tell.\n\nBecause you\u2019re no longer convincing. You\u2019re being recognized.\n\nThis is what most experienced online fitness coaches are actually searching for, even if they don\u2019t say it out loud. Not more leads. Not more attention. Fewer conversations that start further down the decision path.\n\nThat\u2019s why LinkedIn works when you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nIt\u2019s also why trying to figure it out yourself usually leads to frustration. Not because it\u2019s complex, but because the margin for error is higher. Instagram lets you be sloppy. LinkedIn does not.\n\nThe coaches who succeed here don\u2019t experiment casually. They treat it like positioning, because that\u2019s what it is.\n\nThey stop asking, \u201cHow do I get more leads?\u201d\nAnd start asking, \u201cHow do I show up like someone worth deciding on?\u201d\n\nOnce you see that distinction, the platform stops feeling intimidating. It feels obvious.\n\nThe only remaining question becomes: is there a way to do this correctly without wasting months guessing?\n\nThat\u2019s when you\u2019re ready for the final step.\n\nSee how this works.",

It does not scale your future.\n\nBecause proximity does not compound.\n\nAuthority does.\n\nYou are not lacking credibility. You are lacking a system that makes that credibility visible without your constant involvement.\n\nThis realization is uncomfortable because it reframes your success.\n\nYou did not build something fragile.\n\n You built something under-positioned.\n\nThe market has changed around you. Buyers now assume expertise is visible. If someone is good, they expect to see evidence before the conversation ever starts.\n\nNot testimonials. Perspective.\n\nHow you think.\nWhat you notice.\nWhat you disagree with.\n\nWithout that signal, even high-level buyers default to what they can see.\n\nAnd what they can see is often not the best. It is the loudest.\n\nThis is where resistance shows up.\n\nBecause every obvious path to visibility feels wrong.\n\nThe platforms feel noisy.\nThe content feels performative.\nThe advice feels built for beginners trying to look credible.\n\nYou are credible. You just are not positioned.\n\nThe problem is no longer mysterious.\n\nIt is structural.\n\nYou are operating a high-level business with a low-leverage acquisition model.\n\nUntil that changes, growth will always feel slightly out of your hands.\n\nSee how this works.",

      "primaryText": "By the time you\u2019re doing somewhere between $12,000 and $25,000 a month as an online fitness coach, you\u2019ve already answered the hardest question.\n\nThis works.\n\nYou know how to coach.\nYou know how to sell.\nYou know how to get people results.\n\nSo when the business still feels heavier than it should, the frustration hits differently.\n\nThis isn\u2019t beginner confusion.\nIt isn\u2019t lack of confidence.\nIt isn\u2019t laziness.\n\nIt\u2019s more specific than that.\n\nYou\u2019ve started to notice that the part of your business you dislike most isn\u2019t coaching.\nIt\u2019s who marketing brings you.\n\nInstagram, in particular.\n\nYou\u2019ve played the game. You\u2019ve posted, shown up, educated, stayed consistent. And yes, it\u2019s brought you clients. But it\u2019s also brought a pattern you can\u2019t ignore anymore.\n\nPeople who take forever to decide.\nPeople who ask questions that signal they haven\u2019t really listened.\nPeople who need reassurance before committing.\nPeople who want to \u201cthink about it\u201d after saying they\u2019re ready.\nPeople who love your content but don\u2019t value your time.\n\nIndividually, none of this is outrageous.\n\nStacked together, day after day, it changes how growth feels.\n\nBecause you start to realize something uncomfortable. More Instagram exposure doesn\u2019t feel like progress. It feels like signing up for more emotional labor.\n\nThat\u2019s when resistance creeps in.\n\nNot resistance to success. Resistance to what success currently looks like.\n\nYou don\u2019t stop marketing entirely. But you stop pushing. You hesitate before turning ads back on. You delay the next launch. You tell yourself you\u2019ll \u201cdial things in\u201d first.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like patience.\nFrom the inside, it\u2019s avoidance.\n\nBecause you already know the tradeoff.\n\nMore reach on Instagram means more explaining, more filtering, more managing, more of the same type of client.\n\nSo even though you want higher prices, fewer clients, better conversations, and cleaner sales, you subconsciously associate growth with more frustration.\n\nThat\u2019s the part no one says out loud.\n\nYou don\u2019t hate marketing.\nYou hate what your current marketing environment keeps producing.\n\nAt this stage, most coaches blame themselves.\n\nThey assume they need stronger boundaries, better scripts, or tighter filtering.\n\nNone of that changes the core issue.\n\nBecause the problem isn\u2019t how you handle leads. It\u2019s where those leads come from.\n\nInstagram is not a neutral environment.\n\nIt\u2019s designed for browsing, consuming, reacting, and relating. It rewards frequency, personality, emotion, and accessibility.\n\nThat isn\u2019t inherently bad. It\u2019s exactly why it works early on.\n\nBut those same design choices shape who feels comfortable raising their hand.\n\nPeople who scroll all day tend to delay decisions, seek validation, need more context, and look for inspiration before action.\n\nThat\u2019s not a character flaw. It\u2019s a behavior pattern shaped by the environment.\n\nWhat becomes a problem is staying in that environment after your business outgrows it.\n\nAt a certain level, filtering harder doesn\u2019t fix source quality.\n\nYou can raise prices, add applications, tighten messaging, and still feel the same tone in the conversations. Because the platform already pre-qualifies the mindset of the people reaching out.\n\nThis is why some online fitness coaches quietly start feeling resentful.\n\nNot toward their audience as people, but toward the situation.\n\nThey feel like they\u2019ve outgrown the room they\u2019re standing in.\n\nOnce that thought enters your head, it\u2019s hard to ignore.\n\nYou start noticing other coaches. Not the loud ones. Not the ones dancing on Reels. The quieter ones.\n\nThey post less.\nThey sell without urgency.\nThey work with fewer clients.\nThey charge more without pushback.\n\nThey don\u2019t seem busier. They don\u2019t seem stressed. They don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re convincing anyone.\n\nThey seem selective.\n\nThat\u2019s usually when the real question forms.\n\nWhat if it\u2019s not about marketing harder.\nWhat if it\u2019s about marketing in a different environment.\n\nAn environment where long-form thinking is normal.\nWhere professional identity matters.\nWhere people make decisions for a living.\nWhere authority carries weight.\n\nPlaces where people don\u2019t ask, \u201cCan I afford this?\u201d\nThey ask, \u201cWhat does working together look like?\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t about abandoning Instagram or declaring it bad. It\u2019s about recognizing that platforms produce behavior.\n\nAnd the behavior Instagram produces doesn\u2019t match the business you want to build next.\n\nYou don\u2019t want more followers.\nYou want fewer, better conversations.\n\nYou don\u2019t want more leads.\nYou want fewer, decisive ones.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t want to grow at the cost of your standards.\n\nIf this tension feels familiar, the mix of ambition and quiet disgust, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re difficult.\n\nIt means you\u2019re ready for a different room.\n\nYou just haven\u2019t fully seen why yet.\n\nSee how this works.",
